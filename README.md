# University Database

I developed this database to practice the SQL skills I acquired during the ZyberTech Data Bootcamp. This database was created in Azure Data Studio. Because I am on a MacOS, I downloaded Microsoft Remote Desktop and used a virtual machine to host Azure Data Studio. I will be using a JDBC connection in Azure Databricks to pull my dataset from the Azure SQL database.
