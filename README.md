# Univeristy Schema

## I developed this database to practice the SQL skills I developed through my Azure Coding Bootcamp. This database was created in Azure Data Studio. I used PowerQuery in  ADF (Azure Data Factory) to push data into my schemas. From this small project, I learned how to develop schemas,  move data using stored procedures in ADF, and run queries against a dataset.
